### `Summary`

1. **Cell.cs**:
   - Represents a cell in a grid-based procedural generation system.
   - Contains a boolean flag `isWater` indicating whether the cell represents water.
   - Used to create a grid for terrain generation in Unity.

2. **Grid.cs**:
   - Generates procedural terrain using Perlin noise.
   - Utilizes Perlin noise to determine terrain features such as water bodies and terrain elevation.
   - Generates terrain mesh, water bodies, and vegetation (trees) based on noise values.
   - Manages the creation of terrain mesh, water bodies, and vegetation.

3. **LowPolyWater.cs**:
   - Creates a low-polygon water effect with dynamic wave motion.
   - Modifies mesh vertices to simulate wave motion originating from a specified position.
   - Updates mesh vertices to animate wave motion over time.

4. **PlayerMovement.cs**:
   - Implements player movement mechanics including walking, sprinting, jumping, and air control.
   - Checks for ground collision to determine player's grounded state.
   - Handles player input for movement and jumping.
   - Controls player speed and enforces jump cooldown.

5. **MoveCamera.cs**:
   - Aligns the position of the object this script is attached to with a specified camera position.
   - Useful for creating effects where an object follows the position of a camera or another target object.

6. **PlayerCam.cs**:
   - Manages the first-person camera movement.
   - Allows the player to look around using mouse input.
   - Locks the cursor and hides it to provide a smoother camera experience.

These summaries provide a concise overview of each script's functionality.
