### `MoveCamera.cs`
```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class MoveCamera : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Transform cameraPosition;

    void Update()
    {
        transform.position = cameraPosition.position;
    }
}
```
- The script defines a class `MoveCamera` inheriting from `MonoBehaviour`.
- It contains a public variable `cameraPosition` of type `Transform` to reference the position of the camera.

```csharp
    void Update()
    {
        transform.position = cameraPosition.position;
    }
```
- The `Update()` method is called every frame.
- It sets the position of the object this script is attached to (`transform.position`) to match the position of the `cameraPosition`.

This script essentially synchronizes the position of the object it's attached to with the position of another object (`cameraPosition`). This can be useful for creating effects where an object follows the position of the camera or any other target object. In this case, it's specifically designed to move an object to the position of a camera.
